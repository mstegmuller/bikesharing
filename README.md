Summary
The results of the analysis will show that men make up most of the bike riders.  Most rides are around 5 minutes long.  The majority of rides also coincides with the morning and evening work commute.   Given that the men make up most of the riders future analysis for advertising can be geared more towards them when marketing the program.  You can also have more biking stations in as smaller area and more bikes available during the work week.  That would add more overall riders, but it could also have more female riders as well.
